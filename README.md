# GemDating

GemDating is a library for determining the relative age of a set of gems.

The primary use case is when evaluating a codebase for upgrades - a gem from 2017 may effectively be abandoned and could cause trouble if you're targeting an upgrade to Ruby 4.1

## Usage

### Installation

`gem install gem_dating` or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gem_dating', group: [:development]
```

### Running GemDating
